Take on contracts to earn money and upgrade points, unlocking new technologies that introduce more trains and automation tools into your network. With each added station and contract, the complexity grows, but so does your mastery. Experience the thrill of watching your railway network evolve from a few simple lines to a bustling, automated operation. Automation in Rail Route isn't just a feature - it's a complex, rewarding challenge. As your strategy unfurls, every signal placement and contract planning decision adds another gear in the intricate machine of your network. And when the trains glide smoothly through the tracks, operating flawlessly on their own, you'll feel that unparalleled satisfaction - not just of a job well done, but of mastering a world of your own creation.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1124180/extras/june23_gif2.gif?t=1701870879\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unleash complexity in simplicity</h2>Navigate the charming minimalism of the design, reflecting the familiar screen of a train dispatcher yet imbued with a unique twist.
