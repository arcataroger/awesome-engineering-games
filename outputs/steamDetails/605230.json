When you leave the game, <strong>the online universe remains actively running 24/7</strong>.<br><br>This always active game session means that the changes you have made in any computer in the world can be seen by players who connect to them even if you are no longer online.

In the same way you can create your own exploits if the ones that are already available in the world do not satisfy your needs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sandbox</h2>Grey Hack offers a non-linear experience where you progress at your own pace. Publish web pages to share your creations, create guilds and organize attacks against other players, carry out commissioned missions to earn money and reputation, or explore the world on your own where special missions and other secrets are hidden.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single Player Mode</h2>Grey Hack is intended to be played in Multiplayer Mode, benefiting from the richer environment of an always-online universe, but the game also offers a single player mode for those so inclined. In Single Player mode, you play in a world created on your computer. Unlike Online Mode, when you exit the game in Single Player, the in-game universe stops, and progress resumes only upon your return.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roadmap</h2>Grey Hack is in the Alpha phase version 0.7.
