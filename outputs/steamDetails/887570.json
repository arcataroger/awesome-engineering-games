Favor a small task group of robust, flexible multi-role combatants, a large group of specialized ships, or something in between. Do battle in a heavily simulation-based tactical game featuring everything from kinetics and beam weapons to realistic radar and electronic warfare. Nebulous seamlessly blends the thoughtfulness of pre-mission planning, tension of battle decision-making, pressure of real-time action, and pain of inevitable sacrifice into an intense tactical space game that will keep you reflecting on every decision (and mistake) for hours after each battle.<br><br>Skip the economy management: you're here to dominate in battle. Drop into the battlespace with your full fleet and engage the enemy in a tense back and forth where a single mistimed advance, poorly executed withdrawal, or missed shot can turn the tide of battle. Deep, methodical combat based on thrusts, withdrawals, and counter-thrusts keeps the tension ratcheted up without numbing you with a screen constantly full of explosions. With no reinforcements coming, every hit hurts and every loss counts - victory favors thoughtful planning and precise execution.<br><br>It's in your hands, Commodore.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/887570/extras/headline_01.png?t=1701968954\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/887570/extras/image_01_loop.gif?t=1701968954\" /><br>Take unparalleled control of every unit right down to their individual mounts.
