Giant hornets?! You'll need to make the best of things and figure out a way to survive. In this expansive survival RPG, you'll have to find or craft tools, kill monsters, gather allies, build your home base, grow crops, and survive a world that grows ever harsher around you. Find a working vehicle and use that to explore the wasteland of New England! Who was the mysterious &quot;XEDRA&quot; that left artifacts around the dying world, and how are they connected to the cataclysm?<br><br>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is the epitome of a modern roguelike: with turn-based play and a RPG-like skill progression system, it hearkens back to the classics of the genre while building on them in unexpected ways. The depth of this game will surprise you, with a cleverly-designed inventory system, the ability to drive vehicles on land or water, well-written NPCs with their individual stories, and more.
