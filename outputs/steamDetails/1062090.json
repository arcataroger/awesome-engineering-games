Pick one of the beaver factions and see how long your colony can last.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Beaver societies</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-1-Factions.gif?t=1698941902\" /><br><br>Control one of two beaver factions: the nature-friendly Folktails or the industrious Iron Teeth.

Stockpile on food and keep fields and forests alive even after rivers dry up.

Put up dams and floodgates, dig canals with explosives, and redirect rivers to bring life back to the wasteland.

Wood is the core resource in Timberborn, but the most advanced structures require metal.

Power them up, maintain them, and you'll get extra efficient workers for almost any job. They will literally move mountains for you thanks to their unique ability to put up land blocks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vertical architecture</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-5-Verticality.gif?t=1698941902\" /><br><br>Create a thriving beaver settlement using a vertical architecture system. Space is limited, so stack lodges and workshops on top of each other, construct platforms and bridges, and set up a power grid for your growing population.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Day and night cycle</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/new-day-night.gif?t=1698941902\" /><br><br>Build a multi-district city with efficient production chains and nighttime activities. Follow the lives of individually simulated inhabitants throughout their day and celebrate when the next generation is born!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wellbeing</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-7-Wellbeing.gif?t=1698941902\" /><br><br>An evolved beaver's lifestyle is not just &quot;work, sleep and chomp on wood&quot;. Satisfy the needs of your rodents with a balanced diet, decorations, monuments, and more – on top of keeping the colony alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Map editor</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-8-MapEditor.gif?t=1698941902\" /><br><br>Play on one of the included maps or create your own and share it with the community! With hills of different heights, ruins scattered in the desert, and all life depending on access to water, each map poses a different challenge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">...and more!</h2>Ever since the project started, we have been improving the game and adding new features based on community feedback.
