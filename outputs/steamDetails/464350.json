The <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/search/?franchise=Screeps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"  >Screeps franchise</a> is aimed at programming enthusiasts and consists of two games: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/464350/Screeps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"  >World</a> and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1137320/Screeps_Arena/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"  >Arena</a>.<br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/464350/discussions/0/3123802224167555310/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"  ><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/464350/extras/discord.png?t=1702321038\" /></a></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Screeps: World</strong> is an open source MMO RTS sandbox game. With all the attributes of a full-fledged strategy game, you control your colony by writing script that operates 24/7 in the single persistent open world filled by other players on par with you.<br><br>Your colony can <strong>harvest</strong> resources, <strong>build</strong> units, <strong>conquer</strong> territory, <strong>trade</strong> with other colonies. As you conquer more territory, your influence in the game world grows, as well as your abilities to expand your footprint.

Unlike some other RTS games, your units in Screeps can react to events without your participation – provided that you have programmed them properly.
