In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. <br><br>Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.<br><br>What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAKE THE LAW</strong></h2>Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_01.gif?t=1701879213\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY</strong></h2>If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_02.gif?t=1701879213\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES</strong></h2>Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_03.gif?t=1701879213\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES</strong></h2>Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_04.gif?t=1701879213\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND</strong></h2>While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_05.gif?t=1701879213\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PLAY ENDLESSLY</strong></h2>Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that’s why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. And last but not least, Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure.  <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_06.gif?t=1701879213\" /><br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2F11bitstudios\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  ><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/323190/extras/Join_discord_616x230.png?t=1701879213\" /></a>",
