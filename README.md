# Awesome Engineering Games

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of some of the best engineering games on PC. All titles are rated Very Positive or higher on Steam, unless they're newer games waiting for enough reviews.

Games are divided into broad categories based on the type(s) of engineering they're most related to, such as [civil engineering & city-building](#city-builders--civil-engineering), [transportation & route-building](#transportation--route-management), [computer science & electrical engineering](#hacking-computer-science-logic--automation), etc. See the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) for a full breakdown of categories.

Feel free to suggest new games or update existing titles! For now, please [create a new Issue](https://github.com/arcataroger/awesome-engineering-games/issues/new) (or Pull Request if you know how). Easier submissions and better instructions are coming soon.

### Ratings & Tags Explained

* ‚ù§Ô∏è = "Overwhelmingly Positive" overall reviews on Steam, meaning >= 95% of 500+ reviewers liked it.
* üëç = Curator's Choice: Personal recommendations by the maintainers(s) of this list. This is a TOTALLY SUBJECTIVE "best of" for each category.
* ‚òÅÔ∏è = Playable on [GeForce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/). You can stream this game from the cloud without PC gaming hardware (no GPU required). Works in your browser and most OSes.
* üõ†Ô∏è = Playable but still in Early Access
* üë• = Multiplayer co-op
* ü•ä = Multiplayer competitive / PvP
* üéÆ = Has full or partial controller support
* üÜì = Free to play (possibly with in-app purchases)
* üå± = Newer game (less than ~1 year old and/or < ~100 reviews). These are included to give them exposure and early reviews. They stay on the list if they reach Very Positive.

All games (except the newer ones) have at least "Very Positive" overall reviews on Steam, meaning >= 80% of 50+ reviewers liked it.

## Newly-released games

These are newer engineering games that were recently released on Steam and don't have enough reviews yet. They're included here to give them exposure and a chance to accrue reviews, up to about 100 reviews or about a year or so after release, whichever comes first. They'll stay on the list if they reach Very Positive in that time.

## Factory Management & Automation

These games emphasize the building of assembly lines that consume input resources in order to produce output goods, often with multiple chains of inputs to intermediary outputs.

### Factory Building

This subcategory has games that involve building an actual factory, usually by manually mining resources first and then slowly adding automation.

## City Builders & Civil Engineering

These games have a primary focus on city building and utilities infrastructure (electricity, sewer, water, garbage, etc.). They are a typically blend of planning and economy management.

There is a separate category, [Transportation](#transportation--route-management), for games that primarily deal with route-building without the accompanying city and economy management.

### Modern & Near-Future

These take place in the modern, post-industrial era with modern vehicles and power grids.
