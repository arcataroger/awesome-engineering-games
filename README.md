# Factory Management & Automation
These games emphasize the building of assembly lines that consume input resources in order to produce output goods, often with multiple chains of inputs to intermediary outputs.

## Factory Building
This subcategory has games that involve building an actual factory, usually by manually mining resources first and then slowly adding automation.

# City Builders & Civil Engineering

These games have a primary focus on city building and utilities infrastructure (electricity, sewer, water, garbage, etc.). They are a typically blend of planning and economy management.

There is a separate category, Transportation, for games that primarily deal with route-building without the accompanying city and economy management.

## Modern & Near-Future
These take place in the modern, post-industrial era with modern vehicles and power grids.

* (2023) [Terra Nil](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593030/Terra_Nil/) ☁️
* (2022) [Captain of Industry](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594320/Captain_of_Industry/) ☁️

* (2015) [Cities: Skylines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/) 👍 ☁️
    * Curator's Choice: Probably the most in-depth city builder available today, even compared to its sequel (Cities Skylines 2). A great simulation of zoning, routing, economy management, hydrology, and more. If you play only one game on this entire list, make it this one!

## Rail & Sails
This is the pre-modern era, before open-sea shipping, trucks, and air freight were common. They have a focus on sailing craft, wagons & trains.

* (2019) [Anno 1800](https://store.steampowered.com/app/916440/Anno_1800/) ☁️


## Medieval & Fantasy
Before industrialization, or in alternate realities with a typical "old world" fantasy theme.

* (2021) [Timberborn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/) 👍 ☁️
    * Curator's Choice: If beavers had civil engineering degrees and mastered fluid dynamics, what would they build? Great combo of city builder and fluid physics, plus beaver family narratives that will tug at your engineer heartstrings.

* (2018) [Surviving Mars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/464920/Surviving_Mars/) ☁️

## Theme Parks & Dungeons
A genre started by RollerCoaster Tycoon back in the 90s, modern games still play homage to it.

    * Curator's Choice: Build the Jurassic Park of your dreams, complete with genetically-modified supercarnivores, hyperloops, zip lines, and hotels.

* (2018) [Parkitect](https://store.steampowered.com/app/453090/Parkitect/) ☁️

# Transportation & Route Management
These games turn the roads and rails of city builders into its own genre, with a focus on route-building, traffic alleviation, and "traveling salesman" problems (finding the best route between points A, B, C, etc.).

## Realistic Route-building
* (2021) [NIMBY Rails](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1134710/NIMBY_Rails/)

# Survival & Settlement Builders, Colony Sims
Similar to city builders, but with a stronger focus on surviving harsh conditions and managing limited resources, heat/cold, food, etc. In this genre, individual citizens are often more important and impactful, and the simulation is more about the micro aspects of daily life than big-picture population growth.

# Open-World Survival Sandboxes
A sibling genre to colony sims, here you take direct control of one person (or a small group) to try to gather resources, craft, and survive. While they don't all have the strongest engineering focus, most have at least building & resource management aspects.

* (2020) [Empyrion - Galactic Survival](https://store.steampowered.com/app/383120/Empyrion__Galactic_Survival/) ☁️

* (2023) [Poly Bridge 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850160/Poly_Bridge_3/) ❤️
    * (2020) [Poly Bridge 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062160) ❤️

* (2014) [Contraption Maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/241240/Contraption_Maker/)

# Hacking, Computer Science, Logic & Automation
These games have a focus on programming and automation. Unlike factory games, they focus on optimizing repeatable sets of actions rather than resource inputs. Some are graphical, while others require some light scripting/coding.
