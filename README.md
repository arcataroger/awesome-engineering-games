often with multiple chains of inputs to intermediary outputs.

### Factory Building

This subcategory has games that involve building an actual factory, usually by manually mining resources first and then
slowly adding automation.

## City Builders & Civil Engineering

These games have a primary focus on city building and utilities infrastructure (electricity, sewer, water, garbage,
etc.). They are a typically blend of planning and economy management.

There is a separate category, Transportation, for games that primarily deal with route-building without the accompanying
city and economy management.

### Modern & Near-Future

These take place in the modern, post-industrial era with modern vehicles and power grids.

## Survival & Settlement Builders, Colony Sims

Similar to city builders, but with a stronger focus on surviving harsh conditions and managing limited resources,
heat/cold, food, etc. In this genre, individual citizens are often more important and impactful, and the simulation is
more about the micro aspects of daily life than big-picture population growth.

you would actually write "code" (either real code or via graphical coding blocks) to optimize production.

## Narrative Storytelling Games

These adventure games are story-first, and may or may not have engineering in the primary gameplay mechanics. However,
they do have stories about or involving engineers.

## Everything else

These games defy easy categorization, but were "engineer-y" enough in some way to warrant inclusion
